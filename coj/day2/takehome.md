## The Date class - now with day of the week!

Think about how the day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc) fits into your date class. Of course, you don't have to give the day of the week as a separate input - if we input Jul 25, 2023, then the system should be able to recognise that it's a Tuesday. The method you have to implement is:
```
public String getDayOfTheWeek()
```

Modify the Date class you wrote earlier today. Also add a format specifier that includes the day of the week to your program and documentation.
