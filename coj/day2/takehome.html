<h2 id="the-date-class---now-with-day-of-the-week">The Date class - now
with day of the week!</h2>
<p>Think about how the day of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc) fits into
your date class. Of course, you don’t have to give the day of the week
as a separate input - if we input Jul 25, 2023, then the system should
be able to recognise that it’s a Tuesday. The method you have to
implement is:</p>
<pre><code>public String getDayOfTheWeek()</code></pre>
<p>Modify the Date class you wrote earlier today. Also add a format
specifier that includes the day of the week to your program and
documentation.</p>
