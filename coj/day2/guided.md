## The Date class

Write a java class whose objects are representations of a single date. Think about what your instance variables need to be and what your toString method should be. Write the following methods in addition:

* `public Date nextDate()`
* `public Date prevDate()`
* `public Date nextDateAfter(int days)`
* `public Date prevDateBefore(int days)`
* `public String format(String formatSpecifier)`

Invent your own specification language for communicating what the format of the date should be. Provide support for at least the following formats:

* `dd-mm-yyyy`
* `mm-dd-yyyy`
* `dd-mm-yy`
* `mm-dd-yy`
* `dd-mon-yyyy`
* `mon-dd-yyyy`
* `yyyymmdd`
* `dd/mm/yyyy`
* ... and so on.

Learn how to use markdown and create a markdown document that acts as a documentation for your format specification language. You can take inspiration from the way java already formats strings. Add examples to your documentation, make it look good!
