<h1 id="the-collatz-conjecture">The Collatz conjecture</h1>
<p>The Collatz conjecture is a popular unsolved problem in recreational
mathematics. Mathematician Lothar Collatz discovered that by performing
one of two actions repeatedly to any integer, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the integer is even, divide it by 2</li>
<li>If the integer is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1</li>
</ul>
<p>The sequence thus created always concludes in <span
class="math inline">…, 4, 2, 1.</span></p>
<p>For instance, take <span class="math inline">23</span>. It results in
the sequence <span
class="math inline">23 ⟹ 70 ⟹ 35 ⟹ 106 ⟹ 53 ⟹ 160 ⟹ 80 ⟹ 40 ⟹ 20 ⟹ 10 ⟹ 5 ⟹ 16 ⟹ 8 ⟹ 4 ⟹ 2 ⟹ 1</span></p>
<p>Write a static java function that takes an integer as input and
returns a <code>List&lt;Integer&gt;</code> containing the Collatz
sequence for that integer.</p>
